# Copy this file to pipeline-vars.yml, add appropriate values, and supply
# to fly when creating or updating the concourse pipeline.
#
# For example:
#
#   fly -t TARGET set-pipeline \
#     -p deploy-pcf \
#     -c ci/pcf-pipeline.yml \
#     -l pipeline-vars.yml
#
# Note pipeline-vars.yml is in .gitignore to help avoid checking sensitive
# material into github.
#
# Notes on BOSH authentication:
#   omg and the Concourse bosh-deployment resource use two different types
#     of authentication mechanisms:
#
#   1. bosh-user and bosh-pass below below are for omg so it can authenticate
#      to bosh and read the cloud-config when generating the manifest.
#   2. bosh-client-id and bosh-client-secret is for the Concourse bosh-deployment
#      resource so it can authenticate to do the deployment.
